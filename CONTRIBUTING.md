# Development environment setup
The project utilises `vuepress` in order to create pages for our documentation.  
Packages are installed using Yarn2 (aka Berry) for our package management. Due to this, you must have Yarn globally 
installed (`npm install yarn -g`) using NPM before you can execute dependency installation
