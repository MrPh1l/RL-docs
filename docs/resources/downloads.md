## Downloads

### Starting

This a list of useful things in order of importance:

* [Unreal Development Kit 2015](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1z9C3t6nKW1utWilVshODxyGcucxuzbOW&export=download) (or [Unreal Development Kit 2013.2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBLYxCDxIgRtMS7V9SizeY_FpHhWEHxo))
* A full-featured 3D modeling program (such as [blender](https://www.blender.org/))
* [Rocket League Dummy Classes V3](https://github.com/ardivee/RL-Dummy-Classes-v3)
* A image editor. I recommend [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) as free image editors to accompany Blender. If you have Photoshop or something else you prefer, stick with that.
* If you want Rocket League assets, [Rocket League UPK Decryptor](./downloads.html#more-downloads) and [UE Viewer](./downloads.html#more-downloads)
