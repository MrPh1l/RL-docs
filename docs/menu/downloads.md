# Downloads & Assets

You can find here every download and asset from this guide

## Downloads

### Starting

* [Unreal Development Kit 2013.2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBLYxCDxIgRtMS7V9SizeY_FpHhWEHxo)
* A full-featured 3D modeling program (such as [blender](https://www.blender.org/))
* A image editor. I recommend [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) as free image editors to accompany Blender. If you have Photoshop or something else you prefer, stick with that.
