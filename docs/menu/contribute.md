How to suggest new items:
1. Make sure that you've looked at the [faq](../menu/faq), [guides](../menu/guides), [future content](../guide/request.html#future-content) and [inventor board](link) before making a request; it might already exist!

:::tip
You can always [fork the repo](https://github.com/webbuildlucas/RL-docs/pulls) and [pull a request](https://github.com/webbuildlucas/RL-docs/pulls) to add something yourself. It also saves me a lot of time. Create a new file `FILENAME.md` inside the correct folder. [Visit this page](../assets) for markdown tips.
