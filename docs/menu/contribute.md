How to suggest new items:

:::tip
You can always [fork the repo](https://github.com/webbuildlucas/RL-docs/pulls) and [pull a request](https://github.com/webbuildlucas/RL-docs/pulls) to add something yourself. It also saves me a lot of time. Create a new file `FILENAME.md` inside the correct folder. [Visit this page](../assets) for markdown tips.
