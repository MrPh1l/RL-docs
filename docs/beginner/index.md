## Hello

First off, a sincere thanks to all of you for using this guide over the years. I originally made it with the intent to make a series of guides, but quickly fell off the bandwagon. But, here I am, almost 4 years after the original release, and I have finally found the motivation to make the updates I always wanted to.

This guide will attempt to be an all-in-one explanation of the Rocket League mapmaking process, **from installing UDK to playing your finished multiplayer map from the Steam Workshop**, using Blender as the 3D modeling software.

### Me

Who am I? I have a few names, depending on where you find me: Dasoccerguy, Mr. Swaggles, and Dr. Swaggles. I have been using Blender since 2003, though only for hobby-level projects. I consider myself very competent with Blender, but I am by no means a professional and I still have much to learn. I have been playing Rocket League since one week after release, and I can safely say that it is my favorite game ever. Most often you’ll find me shooting some Hoops. (2020 update… this is all still completely true)

### This guide

This guide is intended to help anyone start making their own custom maps for Rocket League, and to open the door to an infinite number of great creations. It will address anything I feel is important, and will be updated as necessary and as we continue to figure out the process.
