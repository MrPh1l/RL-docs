# All-In-One Packages

If you don’t want to stress about this setup process, there are two publicly-available packages which streamline it immensely.

## Dasoccerguy’s (my) RocketLeagueMapMaking Setup Script

This script is meant to hold your hand through the entire setup process, take care of tedious and error-prone steps for you, then generate a projects folder that starts you off on the right path. 

:::warning Errors
It has not been thoroughly tested, so please message me if it misbehaves.

## Newk’s UDK Simple Setup

To download this, you will need to make an account with RocketLeagueMods.com, our little corner of the VideoGameMods network. Newk’s package supplies detailed instructions for installing UDK 2015, and provides a huge set of resources to get going quickly.
