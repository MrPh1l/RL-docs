# Other programs

* UDK (2015 or 2013)
* A full-featured 3D modeling program (like [blender](www.blender.org))
* I recommend [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html#download) or [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) as free image editors to accompany Blender. If you have Photoshop or something else you prefer, stick with that.
