# Installing UDK

After you [download the UDK installer](../menu/downloads.html#starting) from my Drive (or any other friendly modder’s secret stash), double click it to start the install process. Accept the TOS.

**Install with an Empty Game.** The Sample Game has lots of cool things, but they’re completely irrelevant to Rocket League. Sorry.

In the Project Name field, enter a good name for your project. I call mine RLMM (Rocket League MapMaking) but yours will be referred to as `{ProjectName}` in this guide. Additionally, this folder will be called `{UDK Folder}` for the rest of this guide.

Twiddle your thumbs for a few minutes as it installs prerequisites and then installs UDK.

Ignore the extra options, and complete the install. 

:::danger
Don’t launch it, because we have some things to change.
