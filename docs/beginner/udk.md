# A quick note

## A Note on UDK 2013 vs 2015 (and Unreal 4)

One frequently asked question is “why do we have to use UDK 2013?” Rocket League was originally built with Unreal Engine 3 in UDK 2013, so that version had the fewest compatibility issues. In the years since then, improvements have been made and it’s no longer an issue to use UDK 2015. I will be updating this guide very soon with information about UDK 2015.

::: warning
Maps made with UDK 2015 cannot be opened in UDK 2013, but the reverse is not a problem at all. (If everyone makes the switch to UDK 2015, then we will have world peace.)

## Unreal engine 4

UDK is for Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine 4 was first released in 2014, and it’s almost a completely new engine. **Unreal Engine 4 cannot be used for Rocket League Mapmaking.**
