# Request more content

## How

Since this guide is made specifically for the map making, we will not add guides for [other tools](). In this guide you will find the most relevant and up-to-date content. We will, of course, make additions to the current pages and add new ones.

Requests may be as simple as "add an example to the miscellaneous examples page", or as elaborate as "add a page regarding sharding". We'll do our best to fulfill all requests, as long as they're reasonable.

To make a request, simply head over to the repo's issue tracker and create a new issue! Title it appropriately, and let us know exactly what you mean inside the issue description. Make sure that you've looked at the [faq](), [future content]() and [inventor board]() before making a request; it might already exist!

## Future content

* Using in-game assets
* Moving volumes
* Kismet snippet library
