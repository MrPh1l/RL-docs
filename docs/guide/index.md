# Extra Information

## Starting guide

If you're reading this, it probably means you have completed all the steps in the [starting guide](../beginner/ready). Then you're ready to read this guide. If you don't have experience with map making, I higly suggest to read it first. After that, come back and get started!

## Usefull links and resources

In this guide I'll sometimes refer to some usefull links and recourses. You can view it also here:

* [Kismet snippets](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapmaking/Kismet)


## Support

A lot of map making is not discovered (by you), so you will probably need some help along the way. Please check the [faq](../menu/faq) or [contact us](../menu/contact) to get help
