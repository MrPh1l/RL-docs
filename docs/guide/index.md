# Extra Information

## Starting guide

If you're reading this, it probably means you have completed all the steps in the [starting guide](./beginner/). Then you're ready to read this guide. If you don't have experience with map making, I higly suggest to read it first. After that, come back and get started!

This guide will teach you things such as:
* Udk basics ([lighting](), [materials]() and more)
* Udk advanced (Kismet, KActors, [custom materials]() and more)
* [publishing]() and [playing]() your map

## Usefull links and resources

In this guide I'll sometimes refer to some usefull links and recourses. You can view it also here:

* [communities]()
* [guides]()
* [downloads]()
* [cheat sheets]()


## Support

A lot of map making is not discovered (by you), so you will probably need some help along the way. Please check the [faq](../menu/faq) and the [support page](link) to get help
