## Advanced Kismet
I encourage you to ask for help in Discord, or even to reach out to people who have made maps that have features you want to either copy or improve upon. As always, give people credit if you borrow their hard work.

This guide will be updated to include much more information about Kismet in the future as the community and I continue to learn how to use it. Keep an eye out for a library of community Kismet examples, which you can find [here](https://github.com/RocketLeagueMapmaking/Kismet).

Itâ€™s a difficult task to collect all of the Kismet knowledge from hundreds of maps and thousands of Discord comments, so please be patient :)
