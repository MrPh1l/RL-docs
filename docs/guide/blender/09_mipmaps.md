Mipmaps are generated by UDK and Rocket League at runtime to save on memory and processing power. Objects in the background are rendered with a reduced resolution/file size version of the texture. A phenomenon known as “texture popping” happens when the game streams (or loads) the higher resolution version of a texture and applies it to an object while the player is watching.

A similar and related concept is the LOD system, or Level of Detail. This same process and line of thinking is applied to the meshes themselves, including the “LOD popping” phenomenon. Find more information about mipmaps within UDK in the [Custom Materials](../udk/16_custom_material) section.
