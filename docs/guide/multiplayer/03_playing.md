## How to Play Multiplayer Maps

With the free to play update of Rocket League, there are different steps to follow to play multiplayer matches for the steam and epic games client 

## Steam

### Multiplayer

The best way to play custom maps with others is to use the Rocket Plugin. This is a Bakkesmod plugin, which is a wonderful program that everyone should use. It opens a whole universe of possibilities for Rocket League:

1. Everyone needs to download the following programs and files:

* [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/)
* [Rocket Plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/26)
* [Worskhop textures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fvMMw0jGkkGr0fZpme9tWlwD3hC5LX0W). Extract this to the `{CookedPCConsole}` folder
* [Logmein Hamachi](https://vpn.net) or [radmin](http://www.radmin-vpn.com/)
* Subsribe to the [workshop maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=252950&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems) you're going to play

2. Create a new network in the vpn or join using the name and password of the network

3. Start Rocket League and open rocket plugin with `home` or open bakkesmod by pressing `F2`, go to plugins and click on Rocket Plugin

4. For the host (left side of Rocket Plugin):
- Arena: 
    - `Workshop maps`: checked
    - Dropdown list: select the workshop map
- Change mutators and team settings (optional)
- Advanced settings:
    - `Password` (optional): set a password 

Click host

For the players (right side of Rocket Plugin):
- IP adress: IPv4 adress in the vpn or given by the host
- Port: 7777
- `Password` (optional): given by the host
- `Joining a custom map`: checked

Click join

:::tip
- Check if you can ping each other in the vpn 
- If you get an `password doesn't match` error create a new local match and delete the password. Rocket League uses the password from your latest private match
- Using the vpn doesn't show your real IP address
- If you want to play one of Lethamyr's latest maps, you have to use his custom maps loader or overwrite files
:::

### Singleplayer

1. Subsribe to the [workshop maps](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=252950&browsesort=trend&section=readytouseitems) you want to play

2. Open Rocket League and in the play menu go to `Custom games` / `Workshop` and select the map you want to play

:::tip 50 maps
Rocket League only shows 50 workshop maps in the list. If you have more than 50 subscribed workshop maps and dont see the map you want to play, you have to unsubscribe to other maps until you see the map
:::

## Epic games and steam

:::warning Bakkesmod update
Bakkesmod doesn't work with the epic games client, so playing workshop maps in multiplayer is not possible
:::
### Lethamyrs map loader

[On his website](https://lethamyr.com/set-up-custom-maps) is a full explanation on how to use this program and play workshop maps with it

<!-- testing this weekend if it works
### Overwrite Labs_Utopia_P

You can use the bat file from [earlier in the guide](../../essential/05_project_setup.html#batch-script-for-quickly-testing-maps-bsfqtm) to overwrite `Labs_Utopia_p` with the custom maps you want to play. 
For singleplayer you can go to freeplay and select the Utopia map or create a exhibition match on the Utopia match. 
For multiplayer everyone has overwrite the map with the workshop map. -->

## Community maps discord

There's an whole discord server around playing workshop maps organized by BalancedWaffles and even some tournaments are being played on workshop maps. If you're stuck on setting up multiplayer, this server is also a great place to be.
