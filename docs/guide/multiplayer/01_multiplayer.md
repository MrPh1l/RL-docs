## Testing multiplayer

There is a chance that your map does not behave as expected when you play it in multiplayer even when it all works in singleplayer. If you test your map with other people it might be convenient to be **not** the host as you know how everything should work and can probably spot some mistake quicker. 

To test it in multiplayer you can either:
- publish your map to the steam workshop with `"visibility"` set to 1 or 2
- share your map file with the people you want to test it and use a map swapper to play the map

## Multiplayer Limitations

- There's a limit on your map size. If an object has a location higher than ..., 
- Kismet is not shared across clients, more information about how to make sure your kismet works in multiplayer can be found on [the advanced kismet](../kismet/04_advanced) page
